			You can use as many ids on a webpage as you like, but you should not use the same id more than once.
			A class can be applied to several different elements on a page, and in fact you can apply several different classes to the same element. 
			In contrast, an id is used to identify (there's a clue in the term) just one element on the page. And you can only apply one id to any one element. 
			It is actually possible to use the same id more than once, but the point is that you shouldn't.
